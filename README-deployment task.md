# Deployment lab

## Timings

30 - 60 Minutes

## Summary

We've followed some manual steps to get our code on to the production environment. But we should really automate this process

Create a new jenkins job called Your Name Deploy. Set it up so that it performs the steps you just ran through.

Set this job to run when the CI testing job has finished successfully.

Make a change to the homepage of the app and push your code to the develop branch to test out your pipeline.

## Notes

This job should pull from the master branch only.

There are many tools and methods for uploading files to a remote server. We want to keep it simple and use rsync and ssh as we've learned previously. Do not use the Publish over SSH plugins. 

You can create this configuration entirely in your job using:

ssh
rsync
ssh-agent
credentials system

When jenkins attempts to connect via SSH it will ask for confirmation as we saw in the lesson. We can ask it to skip this confirmation with the following flags:

```
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" ubuntu@ ...
rsync -avz -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" ...
```

You can send multiple commands over ssh with the following syntax

```
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" ubuntu@52.50.22.47 <<EOF
	
	commands here...
	
EOF
```
